Assume windows has python. Make sure python has no pyinstaller (use pip uninstall pyinstaller for the windows python installation)
Then install pyinstaller in a python virtual environment (preferrably with as few packages as possible). Use the command pyinstaller with --windowed --onefile core.py inside the src folder
This leads to a dist and build folder. You may extract the executable from the dist folder, and put it inside the binaries folder, or in the root folder alongside settings.conf
The compiled binaries require settings.conf to be either in the same folder or in the parent folder
